# Summary

## 1. **Project Gutenberg Dataset Overview**  
   - **Description**:  
     - Contains over 50,000 public domain books; sample includes 100+ books across 4 languages (English, French, German, Portuguese).  
     - 13 authors total, some with translations in multiple languages.  
     - Folder structure:  
       ```
       Language (e.g., English)  
         → Author (e.g., Shakespeare)  
           → Book files (1–16 per author)  
       ```  

## 2. **Word Frequency Analysis with Dictionaries**  
   - **Syntax**:  
     ```python  
     word_counts = {}  # Initialize empty dictionary  
     for word in text.split():  
         word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1  
     ```  
   - **Description**:  
     - Use a dictionary to map unique words (keys) to their occurrence counts (values).  
     - `get(word, 0)` safely handles unseen words by defaulting to 0.  

## 3. **Function to Count Unique Words**  
   - **Syntax**:  
     ```python  
     def count_words(text):  
         """  
         Counts the frequency of each unique word in a text string.  
         Args:  
             text (str): Input text to analyze.  
         Returns:  
             dict: {word: count} pairs.  
         """  
         word_counts = {}  
         for word in text.lower().split():  # Case-insensitive  
             word = word.strip(".,!?")       # Remove punctuation  
             word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1  
         return word_counts  
     ```  
   - **Example Usage**:  
     ```python  
     sample_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."  
     print(count_words(sample_text))  
     # Output: {'the': 2, 'quick': 1, ..., 'dog': 1}  
     ```  

## 4. **Analysis Goals**  
   - **Key Metrics**:  
     1. Book lengths (total words).  
     2. Number of unique words per book.  
     3. Clustering patterns by language or authorship.  
   - **Methods**:  
     - Compare word frequency distributions across authors/languages.  
     - Use statistical or visualization tools to identify clusters.

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **Dataset Structure**:  
   - Nested folders organize books by language → author → title.  
2. **Dictionary Efficiency**:  
   - Dictionaries (`word_counts`) are ideal for counting unique elements.  
3. **Text Normalization**:  
   - Clean text by lowering case and stripping punctuation for accurate counts.  
4. **Linguistic Patterns**:  
   - Analyze metrics like unique word density to study authorship or language traits.
